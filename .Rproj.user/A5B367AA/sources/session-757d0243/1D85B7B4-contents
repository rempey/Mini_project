## This folder contains a files pertaining to Rachel Empey's master's research project.

## The files contained in this folder follow a data directory structure as follows; 00_raw.data, 01_scripts, 02_outdata, 03_figs, 04_manuscript.

# The 00_raw.data file contains the sample raw data I imported from the palmer penguins dataset. This raw data is in the form of a CSV. file, as it was a component of the assignment to tranfer the raw data as a CSV. into the raw data file. This file also contains a read me file and a data dictionary file to help explain what is found in the file.

# The 01_scripts file contains two subfiles, r_scripts and RMD_scripts. The r_scripts file is for custom code or functions that are special and/or I may want to refer back to sporatically. The RMD_scripts file is my master script and is where I will save all of my fundamental code for the analysis of my project or for general coding. This scripts file also contains the script for writing my preregistration.

# The 02_outdata contains a read me file and a data dictionary file to explain what data may be found in the file. This file is used for data sharing.

# The 03_figs is used for any figures I produce during analysis. Having a specific folder for the figures helps to keep them organized.

# The 04_manuscript contains my preregistration r.markdown files. It also contains another folder called 'rendered' which is where I store my mock manuscript.
